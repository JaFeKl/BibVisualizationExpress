Despite many advantages offered by AS/RS such as improving accuracy, efficiency, and safety, AS/RS operation is very complex started from strategical, tactical, to operational level. Reaching optimal combination for all decisions become important. However, due to the dynamic and combinatorial complexity as well as uncertainty in supply – demand, it cannot be solved through the general mathematical optimization. Therefore, this study introduces simulation–optimization (SO) framework for integrated AS/RS planning considering 7 decisions at a time. Furthermore, a comprehensive mathematical model for measuring AS/RS energy consumption is formulated. The proposed framework is implemented in the China's warehouse company for optimizing multi-objective namely energy consumption and travel time per unit. Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is developed as metaheuristics algorithm and discrete-event simulation is modeled based on FlexSim. The results produce non-dominated solutions that are further summarized through clustering algorithm resulting in 4 different clusters with significantly different impacts.

Under some circumstances action potentials also travel in the opposite direction, antidromically, after being initiated at a distal location. Given their initiation at an atypical site, we refer to these events as “ectopic action potentials.” Ectopic action potentials (EAPs) were initially observed in pathological conditions including seizures and nerve injury. Several studies have described regular-spiking (RS) pyramidal neurons firing EAPs in seizure models. Under nonpathological conditions, EAPs were reported in a few populations of neurons, and our group has found that EAPs can be induced in a large proportion of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the neocortex. Nevertheless, to our knowledge there have been no prior reports of ectopic firing in the largest population of neurons in the neocortex, pyramidal neurons, under nonpathological conditions. Methods: We performed in vitro recordings utilizing the whole-cell patch clamp technique. To elicit EAPs, we triggered orthodromic action potentialswith either long, progressively increasing current steps, or with trains of brief pulses at 30, 60, or 100 Hz delivered in 3 different ways, varying in stimulus and resting period duration. Results: We found that a large proportion (72.7%) of neocortical RS cells from mice can fire EAPs after a specific stimulus in vitro, and that most RS cells (56.1%) are capable of firing EAPs across a broad range of stimulus conditions. Of the 37 RS neurons in which we were able to elicit EAPs, it took an average of 863.8 orthodromic action potentials delivered over the course of an average of ~81.4 s before the first EAP was seen. We observed that some cells responded to specific stimulus frequencies while less selective, suggesting frequency tuning in a subset of the cells. Discussion: Our findings suggest that pyramidal cells can integrate information over long time-scales before briefly entering a mode of self-generated firing that originates in distal axons. The surprising ubiquity of EAP generation in RS cells raises interesting questions about the potential roles of ectopic spiking in information processing, cortical oscillations, and seizure susceptibility.",action potential | backpropagating action potential | ectopic | neocortex | pyramidal neuron | regular spiking cell | spike,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

This complex problem encompasses a combinatorial mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem with a sizeable number of decision variables. Existing methods struggle to adequately solve this problem. In this article, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is deployed to determine the refuelling price to guide the HFCEV refuelling in the TN. First, HFCEV traffic flow model based on the refuelling price in real-world TN is presented. Then, the HFCEVs hydrogen demands in the H2 refuelling station ( H2 RS) microgrid are presented. After that, an IEEE 30 nodes PN exporting electricity to H2 RS microgrids is presented.

Essential stretches of roads to be analyzed were identified using Accident Severity Index (ASI). A Stated Preference (SP) survey was conducted to estimate the trip-wise mean willingness to pay value (WTP) of road users of the selected road stretches based on logit models. Travel time, travel costs, and accident rates were taken as the attributes. The behavior of individual users was interpreted from the coefficients estimated from the models. The mode-specific variables showed relations consistent with the expectations. The willingness to pay value to avoid a critical accident estimated from the final model was found higher for short trip setting (Rs.1.08/trip), which indicates the importance of safety of the short frequent trips among the road users compared to the longer trip setting (Rs. 0.72/trip).",Logit models | Stated Preference (SP) survey | Willingness to pay (WTP),0,0,,,,undefined,

This study first considers the problem of operation optimization in multi-shuttle automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RSs) to reduce both time and energy consumption. A time and energy bi-objective integer programming model is proposed to jointly optimize the storage/retrieval (S/R) location assignment and S/R scheduling for a multi-shuttle AS/RS. The adaptive variable neighbourhood search algorithm and Lagrangian relaxation algorithm are developed to tackle large-size instances. The results demonstrate that the bi-objective model is effective at finding the compromise solution considering travel time and energy consumption simultaneously. The decrease in travel time is obtained at the expense of increasing energy consumption and vice versa.

Automated Storage/Retrieval Systems (AS/RS) are one of the most significant components of advanced automated logistics and manufacturing systems. The majority of AS/RS systems use input/output (I/O) points located in the lower left corner of the rack. These systems are reaching their maximum capacity because of their layout design limitations. Breakthrough solutions are needed to enhance the performance of existing systems. In this study, we examined how the location of I/O station can affect the total travel time. Another strategy for enhancement is a two-step preparation method. In this strategy, the allocation of the storage is changed, in the idle time, to be closer to the I/O point to reduce the service time for a class-based storage assignment. An analytical model was used to introduce for the first time optimal configurations of this strategy. We tested the suggested strategy using a simulation model created using R software, specifically designed for this purpose. Results showed that the two-step preparation strategy took between 1.2 and 1.9 h before the shift starts. The enhancement on throughput is almost the same for both possible locations of the I/O point. The results also showed that the two strategies (location of the I/O point and reallocation of storage) could increase throughput by about 21% to 28%, depending on parameters such as the number of orders and the height of the storage rack.",automated storage and retrieval system | material handling | simulation | throughput | warehouses,4,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,KSU,RSP-2021/145,King Saud University

For flexibility, all IoT nodes were powered by solar energy enough to sustain themselves, in order to consume less energy. To reach low latency, the study adopted the emerging non-orthogonal multiple access technique to serve multiple IoT devices simultaneously. Furthermore, the study adopted the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer technique which transmits wireless data for information processing and energy for energy harvesting. The study sketched a novel transmission block time period framework which plotted how a signal could travel via an individual IoT model. Maximizing the achievable bit-rate of IoT devices was considered to improve network capacity and data safety as well. Aiming at enhancing secrecy performance, a rest IoT relay played a role as a friendly jammer to transmit a jamming signal to an eavesdropper using energy harvested from the power splitting protocol. The results achieved in this study showed that the proposed model satisfied the requirements of future green IoT wireless networks. Derivatives leading to closed-form expressions are presented and verified by simulation results. The investigated results demonstrated that a friendly jammer based on radio frequency and energy harvesting strongly forces the intercept probability performance of the eavesdropper towards one, while outage probability performance of IoT devices towards zero showed that the signal to noise ratio tends to infinity.",Cooperative communications | Energy harvesting (EH) | Intercept probability | Internet of Things-relay selection (IoT-RS) | Multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) | Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),2,1,repositoryvor,Green,MŠMT,LM2018140,"Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy"

In contextual modeling-based CARS, the context information is used straight into the recommendation function as a predictor explicitly. Thus, this approach formulates a multidimensional recommendation model and is best realized through Tensor Factorization (TF) based techniques. It efficiently handles the data sparsity problem faced by most of the traditional RS. However, the recent TF-based CARS face issues such as differentiating amongst relevant and irrelevant context variables, biased recommendations, and long-tail problem. In this paper, we propose a fusion-based approach for determining the list of most relevant and optimum contexts for two datasets, namely the LDos Comoda and Travel dataset. The mutual trust model that combines user level and item level trust is proposed further which utilizes the concept of trust propagation to calculate the inferred trust between users/items. Finally, a hybrid reranking technique combining the item popularity and item absolute likeability reranking approaches with the standard ranking technique of generating recommendations is proposed to generate diversified recommendations. Comparative experiments on the LDos Comoda and the Travel datasets are conducted and the experimental results show an improvement of the proposed work with respect to RMSE of 50%, 55%, and 59% compared to MF-based RS, trust-based RS, and context-aware RS respectively. Also, the proposed reranking technique shows approximately three times more diversified recommendations than the standard ranking approach without a significant loss in precision.",context relevancy | reranking techniques | Tensor factorization | trust propagation,0,0,,,,undefined,

In the modern manufacturing industry, the term (AS/RS) refers to various methods under computer control for storing and retrieving loads automatically from defined storage locations. Using an (AS/RS) is not considered a value-added activity. Therefore, the longer (AS/RS) travels, the more expensive the warehousing process becomes. This paper presents an algorithm for minimizing total travel distance/time between input/output (I/O) stations. The proposed algorithm is used to manage the storage and retrieval orders on warehouse shelves in class-based storage on the storage racks. It contains two steps: the first step is to evacuate some storage compartments (locations) near the I/O station; in the second step, some tote bins are reallocated to compartments closer to the I/O station. Among the features of this algorithm are mechanisms that determine the number of reallocated tote bins, which tote bins to reallocate, and in which direction (toward the I/O station or away from it). A simulation model using R software developed specifically for this purpose was used to validate the suggested method. Based on the results, the new method can reduce the service time per order by about 10% to 20%, depending on parameters like the number of orders and the height of the storage rack.",Automated storage and retrieval system | Optimization approach | Simulation | Storage assignment,3,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,KSU,RSP-2021-145,King Saud University

This paper considers a new bi-directional flow-rack automated storage and retrieval system, in which adjacent storage lanes slope to opposite directions. While such a system can conduct a dual-command cycle, it is critical to operate the system in an efficient way. We focus on both the pickup/deposit (P/D) station policy and the dwell point location policy, considering two scenarios for each policy. We first build a single-command and a dual-command travel time models for each examined P/D station policy and dwell point location policy. Then, we validate the accuracy of the analytical models by simulation, and theoretically compare the examined P/D point policies and dwell point location policies, in terms of both single-command and dual-command cycle times. We find that locating both the P/D station and the dwell point location at the midpoint of the rack is the best policy. We prove the advantage of the BFR AS/RSs over the traditional flow-rack AS/RSs in terms of single-command cycle time, and that of the dual-command cycle over the single-command cycle.

This paper studies TD-AS/RSs with two storage zones, aiming to determine the optimal first storage zone that minimises the S/R machine’s expected travel time. We first formulate an expected travel time model. The analysis is then performed for two situations: (1) the ratio between the number of storage and total requests (Ratio-ST) is constant and (2) the Ratio-ST changes with time but follows a probability distribution. For the first situation, utilising proposed properties, an efficient optimal search-based algorithm (i.e. Algorithm 1) is developed. The results show that the proposed storage policy can improve system performance by up to about 60% and 40%, respectively, compared with two policies used in practice.

Modeling the system as a discrete-time Markov Chain, this study derived the shuttle distribution under each policy combination, and further developed the expected travel time models for both single-command (SC) and dual-command (DC) operations. The developed models can help a warehouse designer or manager to comprehensively make four decisions for SBS/RS, whether SC or DC operations should be adopted, the most appropriate storage policy, the best shuttle dispatching rule, and the number of shuttles. The travel time models can evaluate each possible policy combination quickly through multiple criteria, such as the capacity, customer responsiveness, and costs of shuttles. Numerical experiments showed significant impacts of the policy combination on the expected travel time. Class-based storage, if implementable, is always better than random storage under each combination of shuttle dispatching rule and operational mode (i.e., SC or DC). Under random storage and SC operations, the distance-based shuttle dispatching rule is always better than the random rule, and their difference is concave in the number of shuttles. When classed-based storage is adopted and the number of shuttles is small, the demand-rate-based rule is the best under SC operations. Its benefit becomes more obvious when demand rates become more heterogeneous until some point but decreases as the system has more shuttles. Under DC Operations, depending on equipment speeds, the distance-based shuttle dispatching rule can be worse than the random rule under random storage. Under class-based storage and DC operations, the demand-rate-based rule is still the best when demand rates are heterogeneous. The differences between SC and DC operations are more significant when demand rates are more homogenous. When a system wants to be more responsive to customers, it should be run under SC operations. If the overall capacity is of interest, DC operations are much better.",Logistics | Shuttle dispatching rule | Shuttle-based storage and retrieval system | Storage policy | Travel time model,8,0,,,,undefined,

To guarantee the energy efficiency, the impacts of customer service modes and recharging strategies need to be integrated into the optimization of electric logistics resource. This paper proposes an electric vehicle routing problem with mixed backhauls, time windows, and recharging strategies (EVRPMBTW-RS), minimizing the total travel cost with sophisticated constraints on the time-dependent pickup and delivery requests, limited recharging station capacity, and battery remaining capacity of electric vehicles. Mixed service sequences of linehaul and backhaul customers is allocated for the routing planning, with the synchronous optimization of recharging strategies including the selection of recharging stations and determination of recharging time. A time-discretized multi-commodity network flow model is constructed based on an extended space–time-state modeling framework, which is formulated as a quadratic 0–1 programming model by using the augmented Lagrangian relaxation technique. After the dualization and linearized transformation, we decompose the model into a sequence of least-cost path subproblems based on the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM). The subproblems are alternately minimized and solved using the time-dependent forward dynamic programming algorithm. The solution quality can be guaranteed through calculating the optimality gap between the best lower bound and upper bound for each iteration. The proposed solution approach is examined on examples of a simple 7-node network and real-world Yizhuang road network.

An extended network structure that incorporates three types of traffic flows (i.e., solo drivers, RS drivers, and RS riders) has been useful in RS related network design problems and policy making. However, the extended network structure did not model the matching cost between drivers and riders at each node explicitly, leading to unreasonable or undesirable phenomena. For instance, RS drivers may drop off passengers at one node, proceed to the next link, and then pick up passengers again. This frequent pick-up and drop-off phenomenon needs to be fixed before any efficient policies can be proposed. This paper aims to develop a two-layer extended network that allows to model nodal cost whenever a pickup or a drop-off happens. Search friction of drivers and waiting time of riders will be formulated as well. Accordingly, bi-level network design problems are formulated for congestion tolling and platform pricing.

For platform pricing, we propose two objectives: maximization of social welfare and maximization of the platform revenue, and compare their impact on system performances.

Therefore, the mode choice models (MCM) were developed through binary logit regression (BLR) approaches to determine the factors that influence the SOV travelers’ decisions to adopt the P&RS. As a result, several factors, which included the socio-demographic factors, travel time, travel expenses, environmental protection, avoiding stress, parking problems, vehicles sharing, and traveling directly, were found to be significant and will promote green development.

There still remains the challenge of measuring the similarity between pairs of activity patterns that are in the form of categorical time series sequences. Existing studies measured similarity using binary vector or edit distance, but these methods were insufficient to characterize routine arrangement and time scheduling of daily activities. To address this issue, we cluster daily activities and identify regular patterns using a Markov-chain-based mixture model, which captures features of activity scheduling by Markov transition matrix as well as measures similarity with probability distribution. Logistic regression models are further built to test hypothetical relationships between activity patterns and socio-demographic characteristics. Results show there are three main human activity patterns in terms of daily routine arrangement and activity scheduling: working-education-oriented (WE-oriented), recreation-shopping-oriented (RS-oriented), and schooling-drop-off/pick-up-oriented (SDP-oriented). People in the WE-oriented pattern mainly engage with regular home-based commuting trips, while people in the RS-oriented pattern are involved in home-based shopping and entertainment events. With regard to the SDP-oriented pattern, people plan their trips under a restricted scheduling of schooling pickup/drop-off.

For the finite population case, PDFs are derived using a novel method based on contour lines; the contour-line-based method can be used to derive PDFs for similar problems.

Large multi-site neuroimaging datasets have significantly advanced our quest to understand brain-behavior relationships and to develop biomarkers of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Yet, such data collections come at a cost, as the inevitable differences across samples may lead to biased or erroneous conclusions. Objective. We aim to validate the estimation of individual brain network dynamics fingerprints and appraise sources of variability in large resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) datasets by providing a novel point of view based on data-driven dynamical models. Approach. Previous work has investigated this critical issue in terms of effects on static measures, such as functional connectivity and brain parcellations. Here, we utilize dynamical models (hidden Markov models - HMM) to examine how diverse scanning factors in multi-site fMRI recordings affect our ability to infer the brain's spatiotemporal wandering between large-scale networks of activity. Specifically, we leverage a stable HMM trained on the Human Connectome Project (homogeneous) dataset, which we then apply to an heterogeneous dataset of traveling subjects scanned under a multitude of conditions. Main Results. Building upon this premise, we first replicate previous work on the emergence of non-random sequences of brain states. We next highlight how these time-varying brain activity patterns are robust subject-specific fingerprints. Finally, we suggest these fingerprints may be used to assess which scanning factors induce high variability in the data. Significance. These results demonstrate that we can (i) use large scale dataset to train models that can be then used to interrogate subject-specific data, (ii) recover the unique trajectories of brain activity changes in each individual, but also (iii) urge caution as our ability to infer such patterns is affected by how, where and when we do so.",brain dynamics | fMRI | hidden Markov models | multi-site studies | neuroimaging | reproducibility | traveling,4,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The model can determine the relocation probability, the number of expected relocations and the travel times in storage channels itself exactly dependingon the stock filling level. The travel time model assumes random storage policies. Travel time determination is trivial for single-deep AS/RS, because no relocation necessity applies and it gets more complicated with an increasing depth of the storage racks. The deeper goods can be stored, the more goods can potentially be stored in front of each other in one storage channel. This leads to relocation operations of blocking goods and causes higher total travel times. The higher the stock filling level, the higher is the relocation probability and the number of necessary relocations. The calculation of relocation probabilities in this work is based on a homogeneous storage good allocation structure which leads to a symmetric allocation of storage goods and enables an easy modelling of travel times. This paper presents a travel time model with a continuousstorage rack approximation of a multi-deepAS/RS in closed-form expression. Furthermore, the storage channel allocation probabilities are mathematically proven. The relocation probability for storage operations and retrieval operations are the same.

In this study, two parking locations were designed for the carrier. The first point will be at the pick-up and drop-off station, and the second point will be in the middle of an aisle. Two single tier storage with a carrier model was developed in a simulation environment, each model for each carrier parking parameter.

Methods: The 2015–2019 reported crash data from the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China were obtained, and road transport crashes involving hazardous materials were extracted as the analysis data. The dataset was classified into three injury severity categories: property damage only (PDO), injured (INJ), and fatal (FAT). A statistical model and three machine learning-based models were developed: a random parameters logit model (RPLM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree C5.0 (C5.0) and support vector machine (SVM). The four models were trained/estimated using the training/estimation dataset, and the best model was used to model accidents of the three different severity levels. The main factors that influence the occurrence of accidents at each crash severity level were obtained. Results: C5.0 had the best modeling performance. The direct accident form (DAF), indirect accident form (IAF) and road segment (RS) were determined to be the critical determinants of PDO accidents. The DAF, IAF, road type, RS and time had a substantial effect on INJ accidents. The DAF, IAF, hazardous material type (HMT) and road surface condition were important factors in the occurrence of FAT accidents. Conclusions: Different data have unique characteristics, and the best modeling and analysis method should be chosen accordingly. The safety of road transport of hazardous materials in China is poor, and the losses caused by accidents are substantial. Strengthening the monitoring of travel speed and travel time; improving driver safety awareness, driving skills and the ability to mitigate emergencies; improving the configuration of vehicle safety equipment and the linkage with the control center and rescue center; improving the environmental differences between inside a tunnel and outside a tunnel; reducing the design of long downhill and steep slope sections; reducing the transport plan in unsafe environments; and improving the ability of road management to mitigate bad environments can be effective measures to reduce the severity of road transport accidents involving hazardous materials.",accident severities | Hazardous materials | influencing factors | machine learning | road transportation,11,0,,,NKRDPC,2017YFC0804800,National Key Research and Development Program of China

AS/RS designs employing the newly developed storage policies are compared with designs employing three other (non-turnover based) storage policies, using a design methodology proposed in a recent study. The analysis shows that among the three turnover-based storage policies, class-based storage assignment performs better than full turnover-based storage policy when subjected to different evaluation criteria.

Elderly people in the RS-oriented pattern enjoy a cozy life with much time spent on recreation and shopping activities, while those in the SDP-oriented pattern take responsibility of sending grandchildren to school and taking them back home. The RS-oriented elderly people are faced with spatial constraints to access the sparsely distributed recreational sights; however, the SDP-oriented group is subject to temporal constraints when making daily trips.

While intense occupational exposure associated with aerosol-generating procedures underlines the necessity of using personal protective equipment (PPE) by HCWs, high-transmission efficiency of the causative agent [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] could also lead to infections beyond such settings. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a repurposed antimalarial drug, was empirically recommended as prophylaxis by the National COVID-19 Task Force in India to cover such added risk. Against this background, the current investigation was carried out to identify the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs in the country. Methods: A case-control design was adopted and participants were randomly drawn from the countrywide COVID-19 testing data portal maintained by the ICMR. The test results and contact details of HCWs, diagnosed as positive (cases) or negative (controls) for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), were available from this database. A 20-item brief-questionnaire elicited information on place of work, procedures conducted and use of PPE. Results: Compared to controls, cases were slightly older (34.7 vs. 33.5 yr) and had more males (58 vs. 50%). In multivariate analyses, HCWs performing endotracheal intubation had higher odds of being SARS-CoV-2 infected [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 4.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-16.07]. Consumption of four or more maintenance doses of HCQ was associated with a significant decline in the odds of getting infected (AOR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.22-0.88); a dose-response relationship existed between frequency of exposure to HCQ and such reductions (χ[2]for trend=48.88; P <0.001). In addition, the use of PPE was independently associated with the reduction in odds of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. Interpretations & conclusions: Until results of clinical trials for HCQ prophylaxis become available, this study provides actionable information for policymakers to protect HCWs at the forefront of COVID-19 response. The public health message of sustained intake of HCQ prophylaxis as well as appropriate PPE use need to be considered in conjunction with risk homoeostasis operating at individual levels.

If the stock filling level of the AS/RS is low, the system still offers capacities for the storage of additional storage units, and relocation operations due to blocking storage units can be prevented. If, however, the stock filling level of the AS/RS is very high, the number of operations of the storage and retrieval machine increases due to relocation operations, which leads to longer single command and double command cycle times, which make the storage of goods more expensive. This paper presents an analytical model that can be used to deter-mine the best operating point for the stock filling level of an AS/RS, depending on the travel times and space utilisation level of an AS/RS. The analytical model is based on an optimization problem whose utility func-tion evaluates the warehouse filling level positively and the expected relocation time per retrieval command cycle negatively. This model is based on a travel time model, which shows that a variance reduction strategy is superior to a random storage assignment strategy and can reduce the travel times. Beyond that it is possible to show that the minimal variance strategy can be realised due to dual command cycles.",Analytical modelling | Automated storage and retrieval system | Automated warehouse | Double-deep storage system | Optimization | Stock filling level,0,0,,,,undefined,

Dwell point policy is a vital control policy that can greatly affect the performance of AS/RSs. In this paper, we study dwell point policies in AS/RSs with input and output stations at opposite ends of the aisle. We first propose two dwell point policies. We find that five existing dwell point policies in the literature are special cases of exactly one of our policies. We then develop expected travel time models for the proposed policies, solve these models with the objective of minimising expected travel time, and obtain closed-form solutions for the optimal dwell location(s). We prove that one proposed policy dominates the other in terms of expected travel time. Numerical experiments are performed to quantify the percentage gap of expected travel time between the proposed policies and policies in the literature. We find that, in some situations, the better proposed policy can achieve up to 8%–10% reduction in expected travel time in comparison with the best literature policy.

While extensive studies have been made to analyze the system performance and optimize operating policies for single-deep and double-deep AS/RSs by travel-time models. No analytical models are available for multi-deep AS/RSs. To fill this gap, we develop travel-time models for this system, considering the random storage policy and two class-based storage policies in a multi-deep AS/RS: the one that zoning only on picking face and the one that zoning on both picking face and the depth direction. Based on the travel-time models, we derive the formulation of the optimal system size, to minimize the expected travel time of S/R machine. Simulation models are built to validate the analytical models and the results show that the maximum relative error between analytical result and simulation result is 4.3%.

Based on well-established theoretical assumptions and on a simulation model, the present work puts forward a revised version of the Meller and Mungwattana’s formula for dual shuttle systems. In particular, the constant factor multiplying the travel between time is replaced by a coefficient depending on the rack configuration and on the input and output points of the storage system. The new equation is tested against widely applied models for AS/RS travel time calculation and proves to result in shorter times than the original Meller and Mungwattana’s equation. A linear regression analysis is completed in order to find a numerical formulation of the proposed coefficient.

In Ghana, this kind of pediatric hearing service is available at only one health care facility located in the Greater Accra Region. The current practice in effect has virtually cut-off infants in the other regions from accessing hearing screening and other pediatric audiological services. This has prompted a study into alternative methodologies to expand the reach of such services in Ghana. The present study was designed to assess the feasibility of using telehealth to deliver newborn hearing screening across Ghana. Purpose: To assess the feasibility of using telehealth to extend newborn hearing screening services across the ten regions of Ghana. Research Design: A correlational study was designed to determine the extent of association between test results of telehealth and the conventional on-site methods (COMs) for conducting newborn hearing screening. The design also allowed for testing duration between the two methods to be compared. Study Sample: Fifty infants from the Brong-Ahafo Regional Hospital (BARH) were enrolled. The infants aged between 2 and 90 days were selected through convenience sampling. There were 30 males and 20 females. Procedure: Newborn hearing screening using distortion product otoacoustic emissions were performed via telehealth. By adopting the synchronous telehealth model, an audiologist located at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital conducted real-time hearing screening tests over the internet on infants who were at the BARH. The former and latter hospitals are located in the Greater Accra and the Brong-Ahafo Regions, respectively. As a control, similar hearing screening tests were conducted on the same infants at BARH using the conventional face-to-face on-site hearing screening method. Data Collection and Analysis: The test results and testing duration of the telehealth method and the conventional on-site approach were compared and subjected to statistical analysis. Here, the Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) was used to determine the level of correlation between the test results, whereas the paired t-test statistic was used to test the level of significance between the testing duration of the two methods. Results: Analysis of the test results showed a significantly high positive correlation between the telehealth and the COMs (rs 5 0.778, 0.878, 0.857, 0.823, p , 0.05 @ 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 kHz respectively). Also, the difference in testing duration of the two methods was not statistically significant [t(99) 5 1.309, p . 0.05]. The mean testing duration (in seconds) of telehealth was 27.287 (standard deviation 5 27.373) and that of the COM was 24.689 (standard deviation 5 27.169). Conclusion: The study showed the feasibility of establishing an interregional network of newborn hearing screening services across Ghana using telehealth. It is more efficient to deploy telehealth for pediatric hearing services than to have patients travel many hours to the Greater Accra Region for similar services. Poor road network, high transportation costs, and bad weather conditions are a few of the reasons for avoiding long distance travel in Ghana.",Africa | audiology | Brong-Ahafo Regional Hospital | childhood hearing loss | distortion product otoacoustic emissions | distortion product otoacoustic emissions screening | Ghana | hearing screening | infant hearing screening | Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital | newborn hearing screening | otoacoustic emissions screening | sub-Saharan Africa | synchronous telehealth model | tele-audiology | telehealth | telemedicine,9,0,,,,undefined,

Thus, determining the number of shuttles is an important issue in tier-to-tier SBS/RSs. In this paper, a decision model to determine the number of shuttles is proposed. The model is based on the travel time model, and it considers parameters such as the physical configuration, velocity profile and the probability that the shuttle operates a dual command. Finally, the throughput capacity from the travel time model is compared with that from a simulation-based approach in order to verify the effects of the model. In addition, a critical discussion regarding the characteristics of the tier-to-tier system is provided.",decision model | Shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS) | simulation | tier-to-tier SBS/RS | travel time model,27,0,,,MOLIT,IITP-2017-2014-0-00678,"Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport"

Lagrangian particle tracking is often used to derive the groundwater TTDs. The reliability of this approach is subjected to the uncertainty of external forcings, internal hydraulic properties, and the interplay between them. Here, we evaluate the uncertainty of catchment groundwater TTDs in an agricultural catchment using a 3-D groundwater model with an overall focus on revealing the relationship between external forcing, internal hydraulic properties, and TTD predictions. Eight recharge realizations are sampled from a high-resolution dataset of land surface fluxes and states. Calibration-constrained hydraulic conductivity fields (K s fields) are stochastically generated using the null-space Monte Carlo (NSMC) method for each recharge realization. The random walk particle tracking (RWPT) method is used to track the pathways of particles and compute travel times. Moreover, an analytical model under the random sampling (RS) assumption is fit against the numerical solutions, serving as a reference for the mixing behavior of the model domain. The StorAge Selection (SAS) function is used to interpret the results in terms of quantifying the systematic preference for discharging young/old water. The simulation results reveal the primary effect of recharge on the predicted mean travel time (MTT). The different realizations of calibration-constrained K s fields moderately magnify or attenuate the predicted MTTs. The analytical model does not properly replicate the numerical solution, and it underestimates the mean travel time. Simulated SAS functions indicate an overall preference for young water for all realizations. The spatial pattern of recharge controls the shape and breadth of simulated TTDs and SAS functions by changing the spatial distribution of particles' pathways. In conclusion, overlooking the spatial nonuniformity and uncertainty of input (forcing) will result in biased travel time predictions. We also highlight the worth of reliable observations in reducing predictive uncertainty and the good interpretability of SAS functions in terms of understanding catchment transport processes.",,23,1,repositoryam,Green,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Additionally, a powered conveyor system enables motion along the depth dimension, meaning each lane in the CSR is connected to several storage cells. Horizontal belt-conveyor and powered conveyor in the lane constitute cross-belt which causes the parallel process. On the other side of the rack, a unit load lift, a RGV lift, several rail-guided vehicles and a buffer rack constitute the ASS.

Existing studies can be improved for better efficiency. Therefore, we propose a new ride-sharing model, where each driver has a requirement that if the driver shares a ride with a rider, the shared route percentage (i.e., the ratio of the shared route's distance to the driver's total travel distance) exceeds an expectation rate of the driver, e.g., 0.8. We consider two variants of this problem. The first considers multiple drivers and multiple riders and aims to compute driver-rider pairs to maximize the overall shared route percentage (SRP). We model this problem as the maximum weighted bigraph matching problem, where the vertices are drivers and riders, edges are driver-rider pairs, and edge weights are driver-rider's SRP. However, it is rather expensive to compute the SRP values for large numbers of driver-rider pairs on road networks. To address this problem, we propose an efficient method to prune many unnecessary driver-rider pairs and avoid computing the SRP values for every pair. To improve the efficiency, we propose an approximate method with error bound guarantee. The basic idea is that we compute an upper bound and a lower bound for each driver-rider pair in constant time. Then, we estimate an upper bound and a lower bound of the graph matching. Next, we select some driver-rider pairs, compute their real shortest-route distance, and update the lower and upper bounds of the maximum graph matching. We repeat above steps until the ratio of the upper bound to the lower bound is not larger than a given approximate rate. The second considers multiple drivers and a single rider and aims to find the top- k drivers for the rider with the largest SRP. We first prune a large number of drivers that cannot meet the SRP requirements. Then, we propose a best-first algorithm that progressively selects the drivers with high probability to be in the top- k results and prunes the drivers that cannot be in the top- k results. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.",bigraph matching | join-based sharing | Ride-sharing | search-based sharing | shared route percentage,71,0,,,NSF,2015CB358700,National Science Foundation

This study presents a protocol that directly overcomes these obstacles by eliminating the need to travel to clinic for daily sessions. This is an updated protocol for remotely supervised self-administration of tDCS for daily treatment sessions paired with a program of computerbased cognitive training for use in clinical trials. Participants only need to attend clinic twice, for a baseline and study-end visit. At baseline, participants are trained and provided with a study stimulation device, and a small laptop computer. Participants then complete the remainder of their stimulation sessions at home while they are monitored via videoconferencing software. Participants complete computerized cognitive remediation during stimulation sessions, which may serve a therapeutic role or as a ""placeholder"" for other computer-based activity. Computers are enabled for real-time monitoring and remote control by study staff. Outcome measures that assess feasibility and tolerance are administered remotely with the aid of visual analogue scales that are presented onscreen. Following completion of all RS-tDCS sessions, participants return to clinic for a study end visit in which all study equipment is returned.

Subsequently, an optimization algorithm has been developed and used for several rack capacity. The proposed method allows to find the optimal dimensions of the rack with a reasonable computing time.",Automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RSs) | Discrete Optimization | Free-Fall-Flow Rack AS/RS (FF-flow-rack AS/RS) | Retrieval travel time,1,0,,,,undefined,

In such systems, vehicles are self-powered to travel in horizontal directions (x- and y- axes), and use lifts or conveyors for vertical motion (z-axis). In this research, we propose a multi-tier queuing modeling framework for the performance analysis of such vehicle-based warehouse systems. We develop an embedded Markov chain based analysis approach to estimate the first and second moment of inter-departure times from the load-dependent station within a semi-open queuing network. The linking solution approach uses traffic process approximations to analyze the performance of sub-models corresponding to individual tiers (semi-open queues) and the vertical transfer units (open queues). These sub-models are linked to form an integrated queuing network model, which is solved using an iterative algorithm. Performance estimates such as expected transaction cycle times and resource (vehicle and vertical transfer unit) utilization are determined using this algorithm, and can be used to evaluate a variety of design configurations during the conceptualization phase.",AVS/RS | Embedded Markov chains | Integrated queuing model | Linking algorithm | Semi-open queues,32,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,NSF,CMMI-0848756,National Science Foundation

Further the list of most common indications for intervention coincides with the leading causes of maternal mortality. These mothers who receive active and emergency management at a hospital can be justified to be proxy representative of the unfortunate maternal mortality cases where similar circumstances but dissimilar management caused the catastrophe Thus conducting a study on this proxy representative population can throw light on various factors causing maternal mortality. Objective: Based on the classical 3 delays that model this study was designed to find out the time frame and significant events causing delay in seeking medical attention during delivery on a representative proxy population. Methodology: Study was done for 45 days (1st July-15 August, 2011) days on cases which were decided upon intervention (i.e proxy representative population of maternal mortality) within one hour of admission with a pretested questionnaire administered by investigator Result: 89% were unbooked,. 33% were obstructed labour disorder. 17 cases were referred twice with a total delay of 20.5 hours(transit expense Rs 675), 53 delayed for 13 hours with one referral(transit expense Rs 450) while the last group of 29 delayed 8 hours entirely at home(transit expense Rs 230) 76% received government based health insurance with Rs 100 as transit money. Conclusion: Conclusive findings were large percent of unbooked cases, untrained personels attending the mothers causing delay at initial stage, inadequacy at first level health facility & lack of reimbursement for travelling. Avid campaigning at household level for institutional delivery, proper reimbursement can cut short the delay in seeking health care. Furthermore these study population can be further explored to find out more about the problems of maternal health which require attention.",Maternal mortality | Proxy representatives | Timeframe of delay in care seeking,0,0,,,,undefined,

As a very large-scale example of communal movement, nomadic female sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) travel about 50 km per day as coherent groups of 10–50 animals spread over several km of ocean. From 543 h of data during which 3,873 headings of small clusters of whales or individual whales were recorded, I quantified the heading behavior of groups foraging off the Galápagos Islands. The groups made both sudden and gradual turns. Using piecewise regression models, I estimate that sudden and gradual turns in heading both occurred at rates of 0.10/h. The mean change in heading was 69° for sudden turns and 84° for gradual turns. The mean duration of gradual turns was 1.3 h, so turns were often slow. Using the recorded headings within 30 min of each of 1,798 focal headings, a regression of heading on time gave a mean rate of turn of the group and error of each focal heading about the mean heading. Absolute heading errors increased with absolute turn rate (rS = 0.241; P = 0.0000), so turns were often messy. Thus sperm whales often make slow and messy—likely democratic—consensus decisions when groups change heading.",consensus decisions | democratic decisions | heading changes | movement | Physeter | sperm whale | turns,9,0,,,NGS,002-12,National Geographic Society

However, S/R machine cannot support overly heavy loads, such as sea containers, so a new AS/RS, called split-platform AS/RS (SP-AS/RS), was introduced and studied in recent years. The SP-AS/RS employs vertical and horizontal platforms, which move independently, and are capable of handling heavy loads. The vertical platform which represents an elevator (or lift) with the elevator’s lifting table carries the load up and down among different tiers and the horizontal platform which represents the shuttle carrier or the shuttle vehicle can access all cells of the tier in which it belongs to. Single command cycle (SC) and dual command cycle (DC) are two main operating modes in AS/RSs. However, travel time models in all previous articles related to the SP-AS/RS are only for the SC. In this study, we first present a continuous travel time model for the DC in the SP-AS/RS under input and output (I/O) dwell point policy and validate its accuracy by computer simulations. Our model and simulation results both show that the square-in-time rack incurs the smallest expected travel time.

Uncoordinated scheduling of operations is one of the main factors accounting for poor performance at automated container terminals (ACTs). To increase land utilization efficiency and lower operational times, a new storage system called the split-platform automated storage/retrieval system (SP-AS/RS) has been introduced for temporary storage of containers. This paper describes a multi-objective mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that is based on a combination of multiple interacting sub-tasks. It is aimed at optimizing the integrated scheduling of handling and storage operations in ACTs. The MIP model objective function is to minimize delays in the loading/unloading tasks of the cranes and the travel time of vehicles and platforms in the SP-AS/RS. At the same time, a simulated annealing algorithm (SAA) that provides near-optimal solutions for the problem in a reasonable computation time is appraised. The results of this study show that the objective function of the MIP model is, on average, 58 % lower than that of the non-integrated scheduling method. On the other hand, the best objective function values obtained by the SAA indicate only a 3.7 % disadvantage in comparison with optimal values determined by the MIP model, demonstrating that the SAA is able to provide near-optimal solutions for the integrated scheduling of handling and storage operations.",Automated guided vehicles | Integrated scheduling | Mixed-integer programming | Quay cranes | Simulated annealing algorithm | Split-platform automated storage/retrieval system,9,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

Analytical models of the cycle time for this type of systems are presented, and the optimal dimensions of MA AS/RS for a minimum cycle time are evaluated. The analytical expressions of the cycle time have three real variables representing the three displacement times: horizontally (t<inf>h</inf>), vertically (t<inf>v</inf>), and between aisles (t<inf>p</inf>). In addition to causality constraints of horizontal and vertical transport times, there is another one related to the size of the system and to its constancy. This takes us back to optimization problems in real numbers of three variable functions with constraints. For their optimization, some variable variations are likely to give a relaxation of the constraint on the size of the system, thus reducing them to two variable functions. In the first part of the work, the analytical expressions of the cycle time are optimized, considering the three travel times t<inf>h</inf>, t<inf>v</inf>, and t<inf>p</inf> as variables. The results of these investigations allow determining a global minimum with useful regions where the minima are close to this global minimum. This allows a greater flexibility when designing the system, due to the possibility of making contingent variations on the dimensions of the system, in a wide range, without significant changes in the cycle time. In the second part, one of the travel times is supposed to be constant and then the optimal values of the other two are calculated. This will be essential in case there are dimensional constraints on premises used to house the AS/RS. If one dimension is fixed, then finding the optimal values of the other two is possible.",AS/RS | Cycle time | Multi-aisle | Optimization | Storage/retrieval system,21,0,,,,undefined,

They have interesting advantages, the majors of which are a high throughput, efficient use of space and improvement of safety. All the disadvantages of AS/RS are related to economic factors such as high initial investments and difficulty to change layout. This implies the importance of careful design of the AS/RS by taking into account all constraints. The latter may be linked either to the AS/RS dimensions or to products. The evaluation of average travel time that the S/R machine takes to store and retrieve a product is necessary for an optimal design. The present paper is devoted to a particular configuration of AS/RS said flow-rack AS/RS. The flow-rack AS/RS consists of only one deep rack and two machines; the first is used for storing operations and the second for retrieval operations. Our aim is to model mathematically the average travel time of the retrieval machine under random storage. The mathematical model proposed hereunder is certainly function of the physical parameters of the flow-rack AS/RS such as length, width, depth, etc.; but it is also function of the variety of products stored in the system and of their proportions. The mathematical model could be useful for performance evaluation and for design considerations of the flow-rack AS/RS in real world applications.

This article develops expected travel time models for different operating policies and different physical configurations. These models can be used to analyze MIAPP-AS/RS throughput performance during peak and non-peak hours. Moreover, closed-form approximations are derived for the case of an infinite number of pick positions, which enable the optimal shape configuration that minimizes expected travel times to be derived. The expected travel time models are compared with a simulation model of a discrete rack, and the results validate that the proposed models provide good estimates. Finally, a numerical experiment is conducted to illustrate the trade-offs between performance of operating policies and design configurations. It is found that MIAPP-AS/RS with a dual picking floor and input point is a robust configuration due to the single command operating policy having a comparable throughput performance to a dual-command operating policy.

However, once the system has been physically implemented, achieving its maximum efficiency depends on the way the system is operated. This paper shows that request sequencing (i.e. planning the order in which storage and retrieval requests are performed) is of paramount importance in AS/RS performance. This paper reviews and adapts the most popular storage and sequencing policies to dynamic contexts, and then it proposes a sequencing mathematical model (SMM) to simultaneously solve the sequencing and storage location problems. Extensive computational results based on a thorough simulation experiment plan confirm that performing the requests in the right sequence can have a positive impact on AS/RS performance. Our results show that the proposed SMM regularly outperforms other methods.

An AVS/RS is an automated material handling system for the high-rise pallet storage area of a warehouse and allows pallets to be stored and retrieved quickly and efficiently from their storage locations. It is an alternative to the traditional crane-based AS/RS (automated storage and retrieval system). A combination of lifts and autonomous vehicles store pallets into and retrieve them out of their respective rack storage locations. The crane based AS/RS typically utilizes aisle-captive, mast-mounted cranes that can access any storage location in an aisle via horizontal movement of the mast and vertical movement of the crane on the mast. In an SOQN, it is assumed that an arriving job or customer is paired with another device and the two visit all the stations that must process the job in the appropriate sequence. After all operations are completed on the job, it exits the system, but the device returns back to a device pool and awaits the next customer. Sometimes a job may have to wait for a device to arrive at the pool or a device may have to wait for a job to arrive. Although closed queuing networks (CQNs) and open queuing networks (OQNs) model systems that require pairing of an incoming job with a device, unlike the SOQN, they ignore the time that a device waits for a job or the time that a job waits for a device. In the context of an AVS/RS, the jobs correspond to storage/retrieval (S/R) transaction requests and the autonomous vehicles (AVs) correspond to the devices. Because an AV may sometimes have to wait for an S/R transaction or vice versa, we model the AVS/RS as an SOQN. We build the queuing network by deriving general travel times of pre-defined servers. We model the AVS/RS system as a single-class, multiple-server, SOQN. Then, we solve the network using the MGM and obtain its key performance measures. We apply the MGM technique for solving the SOQN model to a warehouse in France that uses AVS/RS. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",AVS/RS | Matrix-geometric method | Queuing | Semi-open queuing network,82,0,,,,undefined,

This paper extends previous work presented on impact design aspects of automated storage/retrieval systems by determining the expected cycle travel time for single command. Our new study improves the throughput performance rate of new AS/RS's design on cycle travel time that will be specified by estimating travel time for dual command to serve as storage and retrieval (S/R) machine using a parallel wire-based Stewart-Gough platform (parallel wire robot). This improved efficiency in new design is called Stewart-Gough Platform based Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (SGP-AS/RS's). A numerical case study has been presented to clarify the travel time analysis based on mini unit-load storage and retrieval system. The improved throughput has been demonstrated by making a comparison between the conventional AS/RS results and the (SGP-AS/RS's) results in the numerical case study. The effectiveness and ability of (SGP-AS/RS's) has been proofed by determining the expected travel time for single command and dual command for random and classed-based analysis of storage assignment. © 2012 by ASME.,,4,0,,,,undefined,

Particularly picker-to-parts order picking methods lead to low productivity as order pickers spend much of their time travelling along the aisles. To enhance order picking process performance, an increasing number of warehouses adopt the concept of dynamic storage where only those products needed for the current order batch are dynamically stored in the pick area, thereby reducing travel time. Other products are stored in a reserve area. We analyse the stability condition for a dynamic storage system with online order arrivals and develop a mathematical model to derive the maximum throughput a DSS can achieve and the minimum number of worker hours needed to obtain this throughput, for order picking systems with a single pick station. We discuss two applications of dynamic storage in order picking systems with multiple pick stations in series.

The optimal storage zone boundaries are determined for this system with two product classes: high- and low-turnover, by minimizing the expected S/R machine travel time. We formulate a mixed-integer non-linear programming model to determine the zone boundaries. A decomposition algorithm and a one-dimensional search scheme are developed to solve the model. The algorithm is complex, but the results are appealing since most of them are in closed-form and easy to apply to optimally layout the 3D AS/RS rack. The results show that the S/R machine travel time is significantly influenced by the zone dimensions, zone sizes and ABC curve skewness (presenting turnover patterns of different products).

In addition, we derive an approximate travel time expression for dual command cycles for the system with powered and gravity conveyors, respectively, and use it to optimize the system dimensions. Finally, we illustrate the findings of the study by a practical example.",AS/RS | Compact storage rack design | Logistics | Order picking | Travel time model | Warehousing,114,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The stacker cranes can travel simultaneously in the vertical and horizontal directions. However, because the combined motions generally require heavy machineries, the stacker cranes are inadequate for extra heavy loads such as sea container cargo. For such applications, we present a new kind of storage/retrieval (S/R) mechanism, designed with input from AS/RS manufacturers. Unlike stacker cranes, the new S/R mechanism has one vertical platform and N horizontal platforms to serve N tiers of an AS/RS rack. The vertical platform provides the vertical link among different tiers of the AS/RS rack, whereas the horizontal platforms access the storage cells on a given tier. The vertical platform and the horizontal platforms may move independently and concurrently; and the separation of the mechanisms for vertical/horizontal movements also makes the platforms lighter and hence they can operate at a higher speed than the conventional design. We then present a travel-time model under the stay dwell point policy, i.e. the platforms remain where they are after completing a storage/retrieval operation. The model is validated by computer simulations. The results show that our analytical model is reliable for the design and analysis of the new kind of AS/RS.

The closed-form expressions are easy to calculate due to their simplistic forms, even without a computer, while the exact solutions are extremely complex.

The simulated CME is driven by a local plasma density enhancement on the solar surface with the background initial state of the corona and solar wind represented by a newly devised ""steady state"" solution. The initial solution has been constructed to provide a reasonable description of the time-averaged solar wind for conditions near solar minimum: (1) the computed magnetic field near the Sun possesses high-latitude polar coronal holes, closed magnetic field flux tubes at low latitudes, and a helmet streamer structure with a neutral line and current sheet; (2) the Archimedean spiral topology of the interplanetary magnetic field is reproduced; (3) the observed two-state nature of the solar wind is also reproduced with the simulation yielding fast and slow solar wind streams at high and low latitudes, respectively; and (4) the predicted solar wind plasma properties at 1 AU are consistent with observations. Starting with the generation of a CME at the Sun, the simulation follows the evolution of the solar wind disturbance as it evolves into a magnetic cloud and travels through interplanetary space and subsequently interacts with the terrestrial magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The density-driven CME exhibits a two-step release process, with the front of the CME rapidly accelerating following the disruption of the near-Sun closed magnetic field line structure and then moving at a nearly constant speed of ∼560 km/s through interplanetary space. The CME also produces a large magnetic cloud (> 100 RS across) characterized by a magnetic field that smoothly rotates northward and then back again over a period of ∼2 days at 1 AU. The cloud does not contain a sustained period with a strong southward component of the magnetic field, and, as a consequence, the simulated CME is somewhat ineffective in generating strong geo-magnetic activity at Earth. Nevertheless, the simulation results illustrate the potential, as well as current limitations, of the MHD-based space weather model for enhancing the understanding of coronal physics, solar wind plasma processes, magnetospheric physics, and space weather phenomena.

In this paper, we overcome these limitations and investigate an integrative model of a warehouse, containing several storage/retrieval (S/R) machines, which is integrated within a total system. Moreover, whereas performance was previously analyzed, mostly, in terms of throughput and travel times of the S/R machines, this paper considers additional performance measures such as response times, queue lengths, and utilization of the S/R machines. A simulation of the integrative model is used to study the effects of various operations management tactics on performance. The results demonstrate that economic gains are possible while hardly sacrificing performance. The gains result from decreasing the number of S/R machines - up to 20%, and reducing building space as a consequence of shorter queues.",Automatic storage/retrieval systems (AS/RS) | Automatic warehousing systems | Queue length | Response time,20,0,,,,undefined,

We present explicit formulas for the optima! boundary of the two storage areas as well as for the expected single command cycle time for an optimally designed rack. In the basic model each crane handles a single aisle. These formulas provide the designer with a full picture of the quantitative effects of the various factors (i.e., access frequencies of the two storage areas, and dimensions of the rack) on the optimal boundary of the two storage areas and the achievable cycle lime in the warehouse. We also develop expected travel time formulas for the dual command AS/RS with two-class-based storage policies and obtain the optimal boundary with a one-dimensional search procedure. Similar developments (i.e., expected travel time formulas and optimal boundary search procedures) are discussed for AS/RS with a single command policy but with each crane handling multiple aisles. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,57,0,,,,undefined,

Sarker et al. (1991) showed that a dual-shuttle AS/RS operating under a nearest-neighbour scheduling model would significantly improve system throughput performance over a single-load shuttle system. The study was limited in that it only considered dual-shuttle improvements under the nearest-neighbour model. This research exploits the benefits of a dual-shuttle system by integrating the technology with a more effective scheduling technique, the class-based storage model, for reducing the shuttle travel time. The dual-shuttle, class-based storage model produced a significant reduction in shuttle travel time and thus higher throughput results over the dual-shuttle, nearest- neighbour model. This study further supports the premise that a dual-capacity shuttle is an effective way of improving the productivity of an automated storage and retrieval system. © 1994 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Dual-shuttle automated storage | Retrieval systems,21,0,,,,undefined,

The procedure is very suitable for dynamic control of an AS/RS.
